In "Hypothesis analysis of competitor strategy.IPYNB" file you can take a look at analytics process which leads to the following conclusion:

The orders are placed at a certain deviation from the moving average.
Based on the analysis above, the closest version of the strategy is one that uses the crossover between the current price and the moving average, but with a deviation threshold.
In other words, the strategy trades moments when the price deviates significantly from the average and then returns back.
It also resembles a kind of mean-reversion approach.

Also in this file you may find some other guesses which appeared to be not completely precise along with some interactive graphs plotted using plotly libruary in python.

As a result the Moving Averages crossing strategy with threshold was implemented to the given data retrieving the metrics which are close enough to conclude that the strategy has been re-implemented successfully.
